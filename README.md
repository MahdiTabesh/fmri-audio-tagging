## Project Instructions
For general requiremenets, refer to the [project instruction document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P7VZtfaIjJR0Gm_ZN4hK1RR1phwguEgL/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=116178570597880819841&rtpof=true&sd=true).
Please read the project instructions carefully. 


## TODO: This repository is to be used for final project development and documentation by a group of students
  - Students must have at least one main Jupyter Notebook, and a number of python files in a number of directories and subdirectories such as `utils` or similar, as demonstrated in the assignment 2.
  - The content of this `README.md` should be changed to describe the actual project. You can remove the project instructions etc.
  - Provide a discription of the organization of this repository. The organization of the directories has to be meaningful.


## Detailed instructions how to submit this project:
1. The assignment will be distributed as a Github classroom assignment - as a special repository accessed through a link
2. A student's copy of the assignment gets created automatically with a special name.
3. **Students must rename the repository per the instructions below**.
4. If some model is too large to be uploaded to Github - 1) create a Google (liondrive) directory; 2) upload the model and grant access to e6040tas@columbia.edu; 3) attach the link in the report and this `README.md`.
4. Upload your final report as a PDF in the root of this Github repository.
5. Also submit the report as a PDF in Courseworks.
6. All contents must be submitted to Gradescope for final grading by uploading your GitHub repo, similar to how you did it in the assignments.
7. **Make sure your changes are properly pushed to Github, including the exported PDF files**. Always open the repository webpage and check if you could see your modifications. **We will not do any regrades for incomplete submissions beyond what you have submitted. Furthermore, we will only grade based on your latest submission to Gradescope. Any submission before the latest one will not be considered.**
8. After submitting, make sure that all members have been added to the Gradescope group. You can do this by either clicking "View or edit group" at the top-right of your submission or "Group Members" at the bottom of your submission.
